# ClinicTrials2015

The CTTI  provides their clinical trials data extracts available as a relational database to facilitate the analysis of the set of trials. As such, the purpose of this project is to create a relational database for the clinical trials and load data extracts into the tables. This project will be done with T-SQL.

Below should be how the ERD diagram looks like after creating the Clinical Trials database.
