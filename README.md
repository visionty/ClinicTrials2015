# ClinicTrials2015

The CTTI (Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative) provides their clinical trials data extracts available as a relational database to facilitate the analysis of the set of trials. As such, the purpose of this project is to create a relational database for the clinical trials and load the files into the tables. This project will be done solely with T-SQL.
